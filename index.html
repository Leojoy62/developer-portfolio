            <h3>Let's know about love of a dog..</h3>
            <p>"The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs." – Charles De Gaulle, President of the
                French
                Republic
                "Old dogs, like old shoes, are comfortable. They might be a bit out of shape and a little worn around
                the
                edges,
                but they fit well." – Bonnie Wilcox, author of Successful Dog Breeding
                "No one appreciates the very special genius of your conversation as much as the dog does." – Christopher
                Morley,
                American journalist, novelist, and poet.</p>

            <p>Dogs are natural members of the family. They're protectors, companions, confidants. And many
                (well-trained) dogs are excellent with children, showing a seemingly endless patience for the bear hugs
                and aggressive belly rubs that kids lavish upon them.

                    A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to function. A
                    developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such a way that end users
                    have no difficulty navigating the site. ... Large-scale web projects often divide these tasks among
                    multiple web developers.
